# Todo App

Made with the following stack:

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

It's based on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdf5aTYRW0E), I **highly** recommend watching it if you're starting with Angular.

# Compile and run locally

Simply `cd angular-todo-app` and run `ng serve`.
