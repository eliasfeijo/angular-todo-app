# Todo App

Made with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

It's based on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdf5aTYRW0E), I **highly** recommend watching it if you're starting with Angular.

# Compile and run locally

Simply `cd angular-todo-app` and run `ng serve`.
